## 1. Setting up database tables first
- If I had more time, I would research something like Flyway for migrations and an easy way to create a seed file for test data. Whatever ends up working best for Sqlite.
- Starting off just dropping the database tables and recreating them with seeded test data every time the server starts. Might add an endpoint to seed the data on command later.
